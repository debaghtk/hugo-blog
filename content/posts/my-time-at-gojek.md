> I need to be the dumbest guy in the room

this is what I told myself when I set out from college and began my career.
I wanted to be at a place where I am surrounded by smart people, brilliant at their job, willing to learn and willing to teach.

Fortunately, an internship at Codeignition in the summer of 2014 gave me exactly that. I found people with proven credentials and wanting to stretch themselves even further, who not only expect nothing less from themselves but also from the people around them.

Shortly after, I moved to Bangalore where Codeignition would work along with C42 for Gojek. Gojek had launched their mobile app in 2015 but their servers were unable to keep up with the demand. With Sequoia playing the matchmaker role, Gojek became our client and we started consulting for them.

Inside a residential building in Bangalore, a cohesive unit of 30 people started working on Gojek. We all used to have one single standup. After a few months, Gojek acquired us.

I did not completely understand what would that mean for myself on a day to day basis. We were pretty small firms at the time, and I know my founders had always been worried to get enough clients so that they can give out our salaries. I thought maybe they and us will have a easier life now. oh boy, I could not have been more wrong.

What happened next was a roller coaster of a ride, with its fair share of ups and downs. It has been completely fascinating, humbling and full of learning to say the least.

## Go-Kilat: my first product

With goals of learning how software is written and shipped in companies, I began working on a product called Go-Kilat. Kilat is bahasa for lightning (bahasa is the official language of Indonesia). Consumers would be able to order stuff online and get deliveries within few hours rather than having to wait for multiple days.

I had studied software engineering previously in my college but never really had a feel for it. Primarily because when I used to write code at that time, I was the only one who was working on it, and defining what I wanted the code to do.

But now it was different, there were people defining what we need to build, and multiple developers working on it at the same time. Also requirements kept changing. So we needed to be agile enough to incorporate those changes and wrote our code in a way that could make those changes possible.

I got to pair with some amazing developers during this project. Pairing with people better than me allowed me to see how they think of the problem, the solution and how they went about executing the solution. I felt that my rate of learning improved significantly. Interacting with them also clarified my own thoughts and forced me to pickup new ones.

Once code for a story was written, we raised PRs. I got critical feedback all the time, and I cannot be thankful enough to the people around me at the time who put it in significant effort to go through my PR. Even indentation mistakes were pointed out. I always felt that I leveled up as a dev, once I worked through comments on my PR.

But it was not just coding, we had to ship our product too. Being the product engineers that we were, it meant the onus is on us to make sure we ship it. I got firsthand experience in setting up different environments to test out our product. I was always fascinated whenever I got my hands on infra and I took great pride in that.

I still remember the day when we took GoKilat live, everything went smooth. The first order came in shortly, and our product manager personally called the first consumer of our app and thanked her for using the product and asked for feedback and pain points while using the product.

Seeing people actually using something that I built, was a euphoric moments. I had tasted something and I wanted even more of it now.
